## Contribution Guidelines

A lot of people complain about redux having too much boilerplate which makes them uncomfortable when they are about to start a new project. <br />

This project is centered around creating all the boiler plate you need to get you up and running as soon as you can. Please feel free to contribute. Cheers!
<br /> <br />
We will be building a simple counter App which implements redux in both **class component** and **functional component**, Please check the issues for more info

- ## I am not familiar with redux. Can i still contribute?
